Given a number N.Find the maximum possible LCM that can be attained by any three numbers less than or equal to N.
Note- LCM stands for Lowest Common Multiple. Also, Numbers can be repeated.

Expected Time Complexity:O(logN)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(logN)


Constraints:
1<=N<=106 

//code java :

class Solution {
    long lcmTriplets(long N) {
        
        //taking both time and space complexity of O(1)
      
      if(N<=2)
      return N;
      
      //if n is odd
      if((N&1)==1)
      return N*(N-1)*(N-2);
      if(N%6==0)//as multiple of 6 divisible by both 2 and 3
      return (N-1)*(N-2)*(N-3);
      
      
      return N*(N-1)*(N-3);
    }
}
